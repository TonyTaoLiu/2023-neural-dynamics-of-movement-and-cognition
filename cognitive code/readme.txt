Matlab codes for extracting spike matrix from neural recordings and reproducing classification results

Add the whole directory to path before running

These codes are referenced from Neural cognitive signals during spontaneous movements in the macaque
Source code: https://osf.io/zeqbp/
Raw data: https://osf.io/zeqbp/

Noting that these matlab codes are not necessary for reproducing results of this project. The extracted spike data are provided in directory \cognitive data
